## Linear Algebra Math Library for Javascript/Typescript 

LAMATH is a basic linear algebra library designed to be used with WebGL and Typescript. However, the library does not depend on either, so it can be added to any JS/TS project that needs to do vector math calculations.

The library is strongly-typed and provides useful interfaces and abstractions which helps building additional functionality without fixing the underlying implementations.
